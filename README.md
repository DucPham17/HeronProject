This project was created by my team in CSC 285 class created under Professor Forrest Stonedahl's instruction. This project used Java core,
Canvas, JavaFX, and XML to create a program to tracking chickens in videos. It will record the movement of chickens, draw them out, and
give out information about that movement (distance, speed, and where to where). They also can draw a rectangle to choose a specific area where
they will track chickes for research purpose.
